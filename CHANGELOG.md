# Changelog

Every pull request adds one entry at the top, and the topmost version matches `version.json`. See
[docs/ci-and-releases.md](docs/ci-and-releases.md) for the bump rule.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-10 (PR #4)

The Alloy Works mark, wired into every place an icon is asked for.

### Added

- The brand mark as the web favicon - an ICO for browsers that want one, an SVG for those that
  prefer it, an opaque apple-touch-icon for iOS, and a web app manifest with a maskable icon so
  an installed app fills the shape Android gives it rather than sitting in a white circle.
- Desktop icons: the window and taskbar icon, the macOS Dock icon in development, the About
  panel icon, and a tray icon that follows the system theme - a template image on macOS, which
  inverts itself for the menu bar, and a light or dark glyph swapped by hand everywhere else.
- A Windows application identity (`AppUserModelID`), without which the taskbar, jump lists and
  notifications show Electron's icon however the app is configured.
- Packaging with electron-builder: a Windows NSIS installer with its own installer and
  uninstaller icons, plus macOS and Linux icon configuration. Nothing is signed or published.
- The vector masters under `assets/brand/`, with a note on how to re-render any size.

### Changed

- `apps/desktop/package.json` now mirrors `version.json`, because electron-builder stamps that
  version into the installer and the executable. A test fails when the mirrors drift.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-10 (PR #1)

The first commit of anything beyond a licence. Scaffolding only - no content storage, no authoring
UI, no publishing.

### Added

- A pnpm workspace with three packages: `@alloy-works/domain` (the content model, platform-free),
  `@alloy-works/web` (the React renderer, and the web delivery) and `@alloy-works/desktop` (the
  Electron shell). Turborepo orders and caches the build, typecheck and test tasks.
- One renderer serving both deliveries: the Electron window loads the same React app the browser
  does, pointed at the dev server while unpackaged and at the built bundle once packaged. The
  preload is bundled into a self-contained file so it can load under `sandbox: true`, and the dev
  server address is pinned to the IPv4 loopback so the shell and the server cannot disagree about
  where it is. Both are covered by tests.
- A typed platform bridge - the single seam for everything that differs between a browser tab and a
  desktop window. The shell is typechecked against the renderer's own contract, so the two cannot
  drift apart silently.
- A `Component` content model with validation on creation, on revision and on anything read back
  from storage.
- Test suites for all three packages, and a console gate that fails any test which logs an error or
  a warning.
- Continuous integration on every push and pull request. The check steps are `continue-on-error`
  for now, while the repository finds its baseline.
- Documentation in `docs/`: architecture, development, testing, CI and releases, the feature
  inventory, and the first three architecture decision records. Plus `CLAUDE.md` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` as the working agreement.
