# Testing

## Test-driven development is required

**Write the failing test first, watch it fail, then write the minimal code to pass.** No production
code without a failing test that preceded it. This applies to new features, bug fixes and behaviour
changes alike. When fixing a bug, the first commit-worthy artefact is a test that reproduces it
(red); then the fix (green).

Watching it fail is not ceremony. A test that passes before the implementation exists is testing
nothing, and you only find that out by running it red first.

Exceptions - throwaway spikes, generated code, pure configuration - need a human's sign-off.

## The suites

| Workspace         | Runner | Environment | Covers                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/domain` | Vitest | node        | The content model and its rules                                     |
| `apps/web`        | Vitest | jsdom       | The renderer, via Testing Library                                   |
| `apps/desktop`    | Vitest | node        | The shell's pure decisions - target resolution, the bridge contract |

`pnpm test` runs all three. The reporter is **pinned explicitly** in every `vitest.config`: left
implicit, some runners print nothing a test logged on Windows while the identical run on Linux
prints all of it, which makes a local run look pristine while CI drowns.

## Keep test output pristine

**A passing run has no errors and no warnings.** This is wired as a hard gate rather than left to
discipline: `apps/web/src/test/consoleGate.ts` replaces `console.error` and `console.warn` for the
duration of every test and **throws** from inside them, so the failure names the source line that
produced the noise. An assertion in `afterEach` could only say that noise happened somewhere.

React's `act(...)` warning goes through `console.error`, so the gate catches it too.

A test that provokes an error or warning on purpose opts out explicitly:

```ts
import { allowConsoleNoise } from './test/consoleGate.js';

it('warns when the bridge is missing', () => {
  allowConsoleNoise();
  // ...
});
```

The gate re-arms for the next test. The opt-out is per test, never per file.

## What belongs where

- **Rules expressible over data** belong in `packages/domain` as pure functions, tested in the node
  suite. They are the cheapest tests to write and the most useful when they fail.
- **Anything the shell decides** - which URL to load, what the bridge reports - belongs in a pure
  module (`apps/desktop/src/shell.ts`) rather than inside `main.ts`, so it can be tested without
  booting Electron. `main.ts` stays a thin layer that calls Electron with what those functions
  return.
- **Cross-process contracts** get their channel names and payload shapes pinned by a test. A rename
  on one side without the other is a blank window, not a build error.

Prefer a hand-written fake over reaching for a mocking library, and keep pure logic in separate
modules from the framework calls so it can be unit tested without booting the app.

## Run the app when you change the shell

Some failures in the desktop delivery are invisible to every suite above, because they are about
whether the process starts and what it is allowed to do once it has. Two were found by running the
app and would have passed CI indefinitely:

- The dev server bound `::1` while the shell waited on `127.0.0.1`, so `wait-on` blocked forever and
  the window never opened - **no error, just a hang**.
- The preload was compiled rather than bundled, so its relative `require` threw inside the sandbox,
  the bridge was never injected, and the desktop window silently reported itself as `web`.

Both now have tests, and both tests only exist because someone ran `pnpm app` and looked. So:
**changing the shell, the preload, the dev scripts or the Vite server config means running
`pnpm app` and reading what the window says**, not just watching the suites go green.

A note on that second one: `resolveBridge` falls back to the browser implementation when
`window.alloyWorks` is absent, and it cannot distinguish "no shell injected one" from "the shell
tried and failed". That fallback is right for the web delivery and it is what made the bug quiet.
Graceful degradation hides failures - so where a fallback exists, something else has to be watching.

## Not wired up yet

**There is no browser suite.** jsdom has no layout engine, so any question about _rendered_ output -
geometry, measurement, what an editor actually draws - cannot be answered there; a test asserting it
would be testing jsdom's polyfill. When the product grows a surface that needs it, add a Playwright
suite as `pnpm test:browser` and run it as a separate CI step. Until then, do not fake it in jsdom.

**There is no coverage gate.** Adding one before the product exists would measure the scaffolding.
