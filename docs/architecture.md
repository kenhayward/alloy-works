# Architecture

> Status: scaffolding. The workspaces, the split between web and desktop, and the seam between them
> are real and tested. The product on top of them is not written yet - the single `Component` in
> `packages/domain` exists to prove the path end to end, not to fix a content model.

## Workspaces

One pnpm workspace, one lock file, three packages.

| Workspace         | Package                | Holds                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/domain` | `@alloy-works/domain`  | The content model and its rules. Pure TypeScript + zod - no React, no Electron, no `fs` |
| `apps/web`        | `@alloy-works/web`     | The renderer: React + TypeScript + Vite. The entire UI, in both deliveries              |
| `apps/desktop`    | `@alloy-works/desktop` | The Electron shell: main process and preload. No UI of its own                          |

Dependencies point one way: `apps/web` depends on `@alloy-works/domain`; `apps/desktop` depends on
`@alloy-works/web` **for types only** (see the platform bridge below). The domain package depends on
neither and can be used from anywhere - a server, a CLI, a test - without dragging a UI along.

## One renderer, two deliveries

`apps/web` **is** the web application, and it is also the thing the Electron window loads. There is
no second copy of the UI and no per-delivery fork of a component.

```
                    packages/domain          (content rules, platform-free)
                            |
                            v
                       apps/web              (React renderer - the whole UI)
                       /        \
          built and served    loaded by
          as a web app        apps/desktop in a BrowserWindow
```

The shell decides where to load the renderer from, and that decision is a pure function
(`resolveRendererTarget` in `apps/desktop/src/shell.ts`) so it can be tested without booting
Electron:

- **Unpackaged** - loads `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, the Vite dev server, so a renderer edit
  hot-reloads inside the desktop window. The address is pinned to the **IPv4 loopback**, not
  `localhost`: Node 17+ resolves `localhost` to `::1` first, so a Vite server left on the default
  host binds IPv6 only and the shell's `wait-on tcp:127.0.0.1:5173` blocks forever - a hang with no
  error and no window. Vite's `server.host`, the shell's `DEV_SERVER_URL` and the `dev` script all
  name the same literal address, and a test fails when they drift apart.
- **Packaged** - loads `apps/web/dist/index.html` from disk. The renderer is built with
  `base: './'` for exactly this reason: an absolute `/assets/...` URL resolves against the
  filesystem root under `file://` and the window comes up blank.

## The platform bridge

Everything that differs between a browser tab and an Electron window arrives through one interface,
so nothing above it has to ask which delivery it is running in.

```ts
interface PlatformInfo {
  readonly delivery: 'web' | 'desktop';
  readonly runtime: string;
}

interface PlatformBridge {
  getPlatformInfo(): Promise<PlatformInfo>;
}
```

- The contract lives in `apps/web/src/platform/contract.ts` and is deliberately **free of DOM
  types**, because the CommonJS Electron shell typechecks against it too. `window` lives next door
  in `bridge.ts`, which only the renderer imports.
- `resolveBridge()` returns the injected bridge if the host provided one, and a browser
  implementation otherwise. The renderer never branches on "am I in Electron".
- The shell's `describePlatform` is typed to return the renderer's own `PlatformInfo`, so changing
  the contract without changing the shell is a **typecheck failure**, not a wrong value in a window.

### The cross-process surface

| Direction        | Mechanism                        | Channel                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Renderer -> main | `ipcRenderer.invoke` via preload | `alloy-works:platform-info` |

Rules that hold for every channel added later:

- **The renderer is untrusted.** `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`,
  `sandbox: true`. The preload exposes a narrow, enumerated surface - never a general "run this
  `fs` call for me" bridge.
- Every handler **validates its own arguments in the main process**. The renderer having already
  checked is not a check.
- Channels are namespaced (`alloy-works:`) so an unrelated handler cannot answer them, and the
  channel name and the injected global name are pinned by tests in `apps/desktop/src/shell.test.ts`.
  A rename on one side without the other is a blank window, not a build error.

## Data flow today

There is no storage layer, no server and no persistence. The renderer builds one `Component`
through the domain package at module load and renders it, and asks the bridge which delivery it is
running under. That is the whole flow. A real content store, and the port it sits behind, is a
design decision that has not been taken - see [decisions/](decisions/) when it is.

## Build and packaging

| Workspace         | Build                               | Output                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/domain` | `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`        | `dist/` - JS, `.d.ts` and source maps        |
| `apps/web`        | `vite build`                        | `dist/` - the static renderer bundle         |
| `apps/desktop`    | `tsc`, then esbuild for the preload | `dist/main.js`, `dist/preload.js` (CommonJS) |

**The preload is bundled, not merely compiled.** The window is created with `sandbox: true`, and a
sandboxed preload can `require` only `electron` and a small set of Node built-ins - a relative
`require` throws before `contextBridge` is reached. `tsc` alone emits `require("./shell.js")`, and
the failure is **silent**: the bridge is never injected, `resolveBridge` falls back to the browser
implementation, and the desktop window reports itself as `web`. So esbuild bundles `preload.ts` into
one self-contained file with `electron` left external, and a test fails the build if a relative
`require` reappears in the output.

Turborepo orders these: `build`, `typecheck` and `test` all declare `dependsOn: ["^build"]`, so the
domain package is built before anything that imports it.

The Electron main process is **CommonJS** on purpose. An ESM main process would force
`sandbox: false` on the preload, which is a worse trade than the one import attribute the CommonJS
side needs to type-import from an ESM package (see the comment in `apps/desktop/src/shell.ts`).

## Packaging

`apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml` produces a Windows NSIS installer, and carries macOS and Linux
configuration that has not been run. There is **no signing, no notarisation, no auto-update and no
release workflow** - `pnpm --filter @alloy-works/desktop package` builds one locally. When releases
are wired up they run on a **tag**, not on every PR.

Two layout facts the shell depends on:

- **The renderer is copied into the bundle as `renderer/`.** `apps/web` does not exist inside the
  package, so `files` maps `../web/dist` to `renderer/` and `rendererIndexHtml` resolves that path
  when `app.isPackaged` is true.
- **Images are unpacked out of the asar.** Electron's **native** image loader is not asar-aware,
  even though Node's `fs` is - so a tray or window icon path inside `app.asar` reads fine from
  JavaScript and produces no icon at all, with no error. The tray images and the window icon are
  listed in `asarUnpack` and read from `app.asar.unpacked` via `assetRoot()`. The renderer is
  deliberately **not** unpacked: `loadFile` goes through the asar-aware path.

## Icons

The vector masters live in `assets/brand/`; everything else is rendered from them. An icon path is
never a build error in any of these mechanisms - the platform substitutes its own default silently -
so every path below is checked against the disk by a test.

| Where                     | Mechanism                                 | Asset                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Browser tab               | `<link rel="icon">`, ICO and SVG          | `apps/web/public/favicon.ico`, `mark-light.svg` |
| iOS home screen           | `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`           | `apps/web/public/apple-touch-icon.png` (opaque) |
| Installed web app         | `site.webmanifest`, incl. a maskable icon | `apps/web/public/icon-*.png`                    |
| Window and taskbar        | `BrowserWindow({ icon })`                 | `apps/desktop/assets/icon.png`                  |
| macOS Dock, development   | `app.dock.setIcon()`                      | same                                            |
| About panel               | `app.setAboutPanelOptions({ iconPath })`  | same                                            |
| Tray / menu bar           | `new Tray()`, theme-aware                 | `apps/desktop/assets/tray/*`                    |
| Windows app identity      | `app.setAppUserModelId()`                 | none - see below                                |
| Application icon          | electron-builder `win`/`mac`/`linux`      | `apps/desktop/build/*`                          |
| Installer and uninstaller | electron-builder `nsis`                   | `apps/desktop/build/icon.ico`                   |

**`AppUserModelID` is the one with no asset.** Windows groups taskbar buttons, jump lists and toast
notifications by that id rather than by the window or the executable; left unset, the app inherits
Electron's identity and shows Electron's icon however the other icons are configured. It must equal
`appId` in the packaging config, and a test asserts it does.

**The tray needs three files, not one.** macOS takes a template image and inverts it for the menu
bar itself; Windows and Linux have no such concept, so the glyph is swapped against
`nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors` and re-swapped when the theme changes. Each variant ships an
`@2x` companion, which Electron finds on its own from the 1x path.
